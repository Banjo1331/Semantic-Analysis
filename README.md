# Semantic-Analysis
This Github holds a series of related semantic analysis projects. 
It begins with labeled Tweets about the weather and Bayesian analysis to predict users' feelings.
Its next step is webscraping data from Google News to use as test data in similar analysis.
After successful webscraping, that data will have to be labeled, but likely move toward unsupervised learning to continue labeling input data.
Its end goal is to accurately predict public perception of various companies from Google News articles, and combine that data into a sense of each company's current standing in public opinion.
